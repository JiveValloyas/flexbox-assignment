    <p>I think that today’s topics are quite useful and really interesting since it will make working together much easier. We do not have to worry about different code anymore since we could just share it by using git. Making cleaner code will be important since the master branch will have to test them if they are working or not. By using git we aren’t subjected to copying each other’s code since we could just share ours with each other. I would rate my understanding to a 2. </p>
